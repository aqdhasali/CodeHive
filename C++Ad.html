                    <legend>Future of C++</legend>
                    <p>C++ has been around for over three decades and continues to be a widely used programming language today. Despite the emergence of newer languages, C++ remains popular for its performance and low-level control.
                       With the release of C++20, the language has been updated to include new features such as modules, concepts, and coroutines. These updates aim to improve the language's usability and make it easier to write robust and efficient code. 
                       As technology continues to evolve, C++ will remain relevant for developing high-performance applications, especially in areas such as game development, scientific computing, and real-time systems. 
                       Additionally, with the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning, C++ is likely to remain an important language for implementing performance-critical components of such systems. 
                       Overall, the future of C++ looks promising, and the language is expected to continue to evolve to meet the needs of modern software development.
